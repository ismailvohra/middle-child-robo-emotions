Welcome to the chaotic world of "Middle Child," a game that hilariously reflects our neglectful treatment of city delivery robots. In this tap-centric adventure, dive into the plight of these lonely, misunderstood bots who navigate the urban jungle facing snowstorms, human obstacles, and the occasional misplaced trash bin.

ðŸ¤– Gameplay Overview:
Middle Child is a dumb, yet entertaining tap game where you must help the delivery robots while avoiding monstrous obstacles. As you tap your way through the city, you'll encounter these neglected robots struggling to reach their destination. Your mission is to lend a hand and prove that even in the world of artificial intelligence, a little assistance goes a long way.

ðŸŒŸ Features:
Help the Lonely Robots: Navigate through the city, tapping to evade the monsters and touching to help the delivery robots. They're stuck in the metaphorical snow of neglect, and it's up to you to rescue them!
Avoid Monsters: Dodge quirky monsters that stand between you and your robot-saving mission. Each obstacle adds a layer of hilarity to the game.
Gratitude Not Found.exe: Once you successfully assist a robot, get ready for a dose of absurdity! The robots express their gratitude in the most unexpected and comical ways, leaving you in splits. "Gratitude Not Found.exe" is just the tip of the laughter iceberg.

ðŸ¤” Philosophical Dilemma:
Middle Child goes beyond the surface level of tap games. It prompts players to question the nature of empathy and assistance. Do robots have emotions? Should we help them even if they can't express gratitude? Explore the hilarious and thought-provoking side of the human-robot relationship in this lighthearted adventure.

ðŸŽ‰ Make Me Laugh Theme:
In adherence to the Global Game Jam theme, "Make Me Laugh," Middle Child aims to tickle your funny bone with its absurd scenarios, quirky characters, and the ultimate question - can you help a robot find gratitude, even if it's buried deep within their binary hearts?

Embark on a laughter-filled journey through the chaotic cityscape, challenge your reflexes, and ponder the depths of human-robot interactions in the whimsical world of Middle Child!
